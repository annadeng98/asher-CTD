  Instructions
<ol>
  <li>  Preheat oven to 425 degrees, but make sure you have an adult to help you. Cooking is more fun with 2!
  <li>  On a large cookie sheet, place the butternut squash face up and drizzle with 2 tbsp of olive oil and generously season with salt/pepper.
  <li>  Roast in the oven about 45 minutes, or until the squash is thoroughly cooked through and has nice caramelization. Remove from the oven and allow the squash to cool.
  <li>  Meanwhile, in a large dutch oven over medium heat, add 3 tbsp of olive oil along with the onion, garlic and green apple. Allow the vegetables too cook and evenly brown, about 3-5 minutes.
  <li>  Add salt/pepper, cinnamon, and sage leaves. Stir carefully to ensure all the vegetables are evenly coated.
  <li>  Once the squash has cooled to the touch, remove the meat of the squash from its skin and place it in the pot along with the cooked vegetables. Carefully stir all the vegetables together.
  <li>  Add the chicken stock and allow the soup to simmer for 15 minutes.
  <li>  Remove sage leaves
  <li>  Carefully, using a high power blender, ladle in the soup working in small batches and blend until smooth. Starting with low speed and gradually working your way up. Continue working in batches until all of the soup is blended. Return the pureed soup to the dutch oven/pot you were using. If you find that the soup is becoming to "thick" adjust consistency by adding small amounts of chicken stock
  <li>  Return the dutch oven to the stove over low heat, add ½ cup of coconut milk, stir, and adjust seasoning as necessary.
  <li>  To serves, ladle into soup bowls and top with pumpkin seeds and an additional drizzle of coconut milk.
  <li>  Ejoy!
  </ol>
