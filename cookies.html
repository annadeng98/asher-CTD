    Instructions
  <ol>
    <li>  Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Make sure you have a rack in the top third of your oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat.
    <li>  In an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream your brown sugar, butter, oil and granulated sugar on medium speed until fully incorporated. Add the eggs + vanilla and mix on medium until everything is well blended. Take the bowl out of the mixer.
    <li>  In a medium bowl whisk together all-purpose flour, bread flour, baking powder, baking soda and sea salt.
    <li>  Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and fold until the cookie dough is barely blended. You still want to see streaks of flour. Add the chocolate chunks and fold until just mixed.* Gently roll into 2 tablespoon-sized balls, place on a parchment-covered baking sheet and allow about 2 inches of space between the dough balls. I like to freeze the dough balls for about 10 minutes prior to baking…this step is optional, but I like how it helps the cookies maintain their shape whilst baking (I don’t like super flat cookies).
    <li>  Bake the cookies in the top third of the oven for about 11 minutes. They will look slightly underdone. Fresh out of the oven, sprinkle with the sea salt flakes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes post baking and then move to a cooling rack to finish cooling down.
